Real Estate Rental Analysis is a comprehensive project designed to empower users with valuable insights into the dynamic real estate rental market. The project aims to simplify the process of finding the ideal rental property by integrating advanced web crawling, data validation, and analysis features. The key functionalities encompass web crawling from multiple real estate websites, data validation using regular expressions, HTML parsing, inverted indexing, frequency count, page ranking, spell checking, word completion, and search frequency analysis.

Key Features:

Web Crawler:
The project employs a web crawler to extract pertinent information from distinct real estate websites, such as zolo.ca, rentals.ca. This ensures a comprehensive coverage of available rental listings.

Data Validation using Regular Expressions:
Robust data validation mechanisms are implemented using regular expressions to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information. This safeguards against errors and inconsistencies in the data.

HTML Parser:
HTML parsing is employed to effectively extract and organize relevant information from the web pages of real estate listings. This allows for the systematic processing of data for subsequent analysis.

Inverted Indexing:
Inverted indexing is implemented as a sophisticated data structure that facilitates rapid searches. It maps content, such as words or numbers, to their locations in a set of documents. This accelerates the search process, enabling users to efficiently navigate through the available rental listings.

Frequency Count and Page Ranking:
The project offers a frequency count feature, providing users with insights into the number of occurrences of specific keywords within a given URL. Page ranking further enhances the user experience by measuring the importance of search results based on keyword occurrences.
Spell Checking:

Spell checking is integrated into the project to enhance user input accuracy. A vocabulary constructed from existing words in text files facilitates alternative word suggestions if no results are found. The edit distance algorithm is employed to compare user input with existing words.

Word Completion:
Users benefit from word completion functionality, streamlining the input process and ensuring that search queries are accurate and efficient.
Search Frequency Analysis:

The system tracks and displays the frequency of searches, providing users with insights into popular search terms and trends within the real estate rental domain.

Finding Patterns using Regular Expressions:
The project utilizes regular expressions to identify and extract patterns within the data, facilitating advanced search capabilities.
