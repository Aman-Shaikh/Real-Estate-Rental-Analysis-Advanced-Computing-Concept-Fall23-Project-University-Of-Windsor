We are proud to implement the OUAC Voucher program for Fall 2024. The OUAC Voucher program is designed to provide a nudge for students that have the potential to succeed at the University of Windsor, yet may not be planning to apply, given a lack of confidence, resources and/or support network. As a valued partner in education, if you apply for the OUAC Voucher program on behalf of a student, we will cover the cost of the OUAC application fee for that student. Please consider the students in your midst and if you feel there is a good fit, complete the request form on the button below to begin the process.
